# AI Travel Planner with Streamlit

Project Link - https://avijeet7-ai-travel-planner.hf.space

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that uses multiple AI agents to recommend:

- The best months to visit a location (weather-based).
- Personalized hotel recommendations (via sentence embeddings).
- A complete day-by-day travel itinerary (via Gemini 2.5 flash).

Note: This app is hosted on a free tier. If the link takes a moment to load, the server is just waking up
